# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
questions = Question.create([{ title: 'Star Wars?', description: "It's movie?" }, { title: 'Lord of the Rings?', description: "It's movie?" }, { title: '??????????', description: "It's sentence?" }])
  # Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
